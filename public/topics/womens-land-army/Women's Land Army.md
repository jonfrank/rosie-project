# Women's Land Army Recruitment Poster

This is a British government recruitment poster for the Women's Land Army during World War II. The poster shows a smiling woman in work clothes, presenting agricultural work as an appealing and patriotic duty for women during wartime.

The Women's Land Army was established to replace male agricultural workers who had gone to fight in the war. Women from all backgrounds joined to work on farms, helping to maintain food production when Britain was under threat of starvation due to German U-boat attacks on supply ships.

The poster uses bright colors and positive imagery to encourage women to volunteer for what was often challenging physical work in difficult conditions.
