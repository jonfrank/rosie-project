## Activity
Design a propaganda poster encouraging people to join the Women's Land Army.

Encourage students to think about the reasons that propaganda posters were created - in the context of the Land Army posters, they were created for recruitment, but others were created to boost morale and encourage public support of the war effort. 

Students can use what they've learnt about life in the Women's Land Army to consider how they can present it as a positive experience. 

Your students will have seen one poster during the object investigation, but you could visit these pages to see some more examples:

If your students are brimming with ideas, give them a blank sheet of paper and see what they come up with. 
If they need something to start them off, you can download and print out the worksheet below.
