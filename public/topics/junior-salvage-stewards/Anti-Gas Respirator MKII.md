# Anti-Gas Respirator MKII

This is a standard Adult Mark II anti-gas respirator used during World War II. These masks were distributed to civilians as protection against potential chemical attacks. 

The Junior Salvage Stewards would have been familiar with these masks as they were part of everyday wartime life. Rubber from old masks and equipment was often collected by children as part of their salvage efforts - every piece of rubber was valuable for the war effort and could be recycled into new equipment, vehicle tires, or other essential items.

The mask shows the typical design with large glass eyepieces and a filter canister, designed to protect adults during air raids or chemical attacks.
