# Anti-Gas Respirator for Small Children

This specially designed gas mask was created for young children during World War II. Notice how it's designed to look less frightening than adult masks - it was sometimes called a "Mickey Mouse" mask because of its distinctive shape and colorful design.

Children as young as those who would become Junior Salvage Stewards had to carry these masks everywhere during the war. The bright colors and child-friendly design helped reduce fear and encouraged children to wear them properly during air raid drills.

When these masks became damaged or obsolete, the rubber components would be collected by salvage drives. Children understood that even their own protective equipment, when no longer usable, could contribute to the war effort by being recycled into new materials.
