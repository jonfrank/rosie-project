*Meet Rosie, your time-traveling guide*

Hi, I'm Rosie. It's great to meet you!

Something incredible happened to me last year: I found a time portal in my attic. If I put in the right coordinates, it brings me objects from the past. Pretty amazing, right?

Today I'm going to use some of these objects to find out more about a job that people in Britain did during World War Two. Would you like to help me?

First thing's first, we've got to make sure the coordinates are right. Put the year of the beginning of World War Two into the box below, press the button and get ready to investigate!
